So we end up getting more credit for successfully recommending an item in the top slot than in the bottom slot. Again, this a more user focused metric since users tend to focus on the beginning of lists. The only difference is that instead of summing up the number of hits we sum up the reciprocal rank of each hit."

More responsiveness would always seem to be a good thing, but in the world of business we have to decide how responsive our recommender really needs to be, since recommender systems that have instantaneous responsiveness are complex, difficult to maintain, and expensive to build. We need to strike your own balance between responsiveness and simplicity"
